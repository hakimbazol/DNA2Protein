# DNA2Protein
Simple Python script to predict protein based on the DNA sequence.

We know, the protein will be translated based on the mRNA sequence from DNA.
However, computational biology development nowadays allows us to predict the protein from DNA sequence directly. This code was written to make that possible.
If you wish to change DNA sequence into mRNA, it is fine. But do not forget to change the dictionary in the code.

This code is based on Hong Qin works from his YouTube. I just add the function so this code only reads the first start codon and also stop when it reads the first stop codon.

Please let me know if you have any trouble when using this code.
